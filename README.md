## 🎯 About The Project

The **SAU Question Bank & Study Hub** is a scalable, multi-faculty academic resource platform built for students and teachers at Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University. It solves the problem of scattered, hard-to-find past exam papers and study materials by providing a single, searchable, and filterable repository that supports multiple academic domains.

Contributors (collectors and admins) can upload previous-year question papers directly via image uploads, and link external resources such as textbooks, lecture notes, or general PDFs. Students can browse, filter by faculty/level/semester/course, and instantly access everything they need — all powered by a context-aware AI tutor assistant that dynamically adapts its domain knowledge based on the selected faculty for robust on-demand academic support.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🌐 Multi-Faculty Architecture** — Seamlessly switch across different faculties to access domain-specific study environments, courses, and resources.
- **📖 Question Bank** — Browse and filter previous-year exam papers by Faculty, Level, Semester, Course, and Type. Supports multi-image uploads.
- **📚 Study Materials Library** — A unified resource hub for Books, Notes, and General PDFs. Supports URL-synced type filters (`?type=book`), infinite scroll pagination (batches of 9), real-time type counts, and asynchronous contributor profile resolution.
- **🤖 Context-Aware AI Tutor** — Domain-locked Groq-powered chat assistant (Llama 4 Scout) that dynamically generates faculty-specific system prompts at request time, with image analysis (up to 5 Cloudinary URLs per message), robust error handling, and strict domain guardrails.
- **✨ Premium UI & Animations** — High-performance unified scroll reveals, custom canvas-based Framer Motion hero particles, interactive floating badges, smooth page transitions, and micro-interaction hover effects throughout.
- **🔐 Role-Based Access Control** — Supabase Auth with `admin` and `collector` roles. Optimized auth flow with redundant DB queries removed for instant logins and secure profile updates.
- **🛠️ Admin Dashboard** — Full moderation panel: create users, delete questions, manage study materials, with cascading filter controls.
- **🧩 Centralised SVG Icons** — All reusable icons extracted into `src/components/icons.tsx` with typed props, eliminating repeated inline SVG markup across components.
- **🔒 Strict TypeScript** — Replaced all `as any` casts with a proper `CourseData` interface; all `catch` blocks use `unknown` with `instanceof Error` narrowing.
- **📊 Vercel Analytics** — First-party, privacy-friendly page-view and event tracking integrated via `@vercel/analytics/react`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- **Node.js** `v18` or higher ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** `v9` or higher (bundled with Node.js)
- A **Supabase** project with the `questions` and `study_materials` tables created
- A **Cloudinary** account for image hosting
- A **Groq** API key for the AI Tutor feature

---

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adnan-Eram-Argho/question-bank-app.git
cd question-bank-app
```

**2. Install backend dependencies**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**3. Install frontend dependencies**

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

---

### Environment Variables

Both the `backend/` and `frontend/` directories require their own `.env` files. Copy the example files and fill in your credentials:

```bash
# From the project root
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

#### Backend (`backend/.env`)

| Variable | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | Port for the Express server | No (default: `5000`) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | ✅ Yes |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Supabase **service role** key (bypasses RLS) | ✅ Yes |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Your Cloudinary cloud name | ✅ Yes |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Cloudinary API key | ✅ Yes |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary API secret | ✅ Yes |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq API key for the AI Tutor | ✅ Yes |

#### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)

| Variable | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | ✅ Yes |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase **anon/public** key | ✅ Yes |
| `VITE_API_URL` | Backend API base URL (local or hosted) | No (defaults to Render URL) |

> ⚠️ **Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` files. Both are listed in their respective `.gitignore` files.

---

## 💻 Usage

Open **two separate terminals** from the project root.

**Terminal 1 — Start the backend server:**

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# Server running at http://localhost:5000
```

**Terminal 2 — Start the frontend development server:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# App running at http://localhost:5173
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

> 💡 **Tip:** When running locally, set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000` in `frontend/.env` so the frontend communicates with your local backend instead of the hosted Render API.

---

## 📡 API Reference

All endpoints are served from the Express backend. Base URL: `http://localhost:5000` (local) or your Render deployment URL.

| `GET` | `/api/contributors` | None | Fetch all contributor profiles |
| `POST` | `/api/upload` | Collector | Upload question paper images to Cloudinary + Supabase |
| `POST` | `/api/upload-material` | Collector | Add a book, note, or PDF record (Drive link) |
| `POST` | `/api/chat-tutor` | None | Send message + optional images (≤5) to the faculty-aware AI Tutor (Llama 4 Scout) |
| `POST` | `/api/user/profile` | Authenticated | Update user profile name, bio, and avatar |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/users` | Admin | List all registered users |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/create-user` | Admin | Create a new user account |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/users/:id` | Admin | Delete a user and their avatar from Cloudinary |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/questions/:id` | Admin | Delete a question and its images from Cloudinary |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/materials/:id` | Admin | Delete a study material record |

### `POST /api/chat-tutor` — Request Body

```json
{
  "message": "Explain the law of demand.",
  "faculty": "Agricultural Economics",
  "history": [
    { "role": "user", "text": "Hello" },
    { "role": "assistant", "text": "Hi! How can I help?" }
  ],
  "images": ["https://res.cloudinary.com/.../question.jpg"]
}
```

> The `faculty` field drives the system prompt; defaults to `"Agricultural Economics"` if omitted. The `images` array accepts up to 5 Cloudinary URLs and is passed directly to the Groq vision API.
